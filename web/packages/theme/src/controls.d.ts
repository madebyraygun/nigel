/**
 * The brand treatment for Web Awesome primitives, adopted by the components
 * that render them.
 *
 * `::part()` reaches exactly one shadow boundary down, and it reaches it from
 * the tree the rule is written in. Every `wa-*` primitive here lives inside a
 * `wc-*` shadow root, which lives inside a screen's, which lives inside
 * `nigel-app`'s — so a document-level copy of these rules cannot even select
 * the host, let alone its parts. The sheet therefore has to be adopted by the
 * component that *hosts* the primitive; an ancestor's copy is already one
 * boundary too far.
 *
 * `static styles = [controlsCss, css\`…\`]` is the shape, and the order is
 * load bearing: a component's own rules come after so it can still override
 * the shared treatment. A source-scan guard test in each package fails the
 * build when a file imports a `wa-*` component module without adopting this.
 *
 * Tokens are the other way through the boundary and need none of this — custom
 * properties inherit, which is why the document sheet still owns them.
