## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Scaffold the Tauri 2 app hosting the SPA over the transport settled in decision-1: one custom URI scheme serving both the embedded SPA and the JSON API from the same build_router() that nigel serve builds, driven by register_asynchronous_uri_scheme_protocol rather than a TcpListener. No TCP port and no CORS, because the app and its API are same-origin. FetchApiClient changes by one constructor argument, computed at runtime because the URL form differs by platform (nigel://localhost on macOS and Linux, http://nigel.localhost on Windows). Document the desktop dev workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The desktop app boots the SPA against a local database end to end
- [x] #2 The transport decision is recorded in backlog/decisions with rationale
- [ ] #3 The api client seam holds: web mode still works from the same SPA code
- [ ] #4 Desktop dev workflow is documented
- [ ] #5 Download behaviour under the custom scheme is verified on macOS, Windows and Linux before the shell is built around it; if a webview refuses <a download>/Content-Disposition, exportUrl's contract changes in the api seam rather than in screens
- [ ] #6 The Host/Origin guard takes a configured trusted origin instead of a hardcoded loopback list, with tests for both the desktop and the loopback forms
- [ ] #7 The desktop router is constructed without the session guard, as a property of construction rather than a runtime flag, and that is tested
- [ ] #8 The scheme is not registered as a deep link
